                    <a href="https://jackah2.github.io/mcie-viz/" target="_blank"><b>The Minecraft Interest Engine (MCIE)</b></a> is a system that aims
                    to use a session of Minecraft play time to predict up to five areas of STEM the player is interested in.
                    The analysis of each session is broken down by the duration of the session; how many blocks were traveled, placed, and broken;
                    and the amount of commands that were executed by the player.
                    The engine looks at which blocks were interacted with in order to determine which fields of STEM the player is most likely interested in.
                    The backend - which handles the analyzation of the data - is written in Java.
                    All of the data is stored in a MySQL database and is accessed by the backend.
                    I then used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="blank_"><b>Amazon Web Services</b></a> to deliver the analysed data to the front end.
                    I used <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="blank_"><b>Node.js</b></a> and
                    <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="blank_"><b>React</b></a> to create the front end.
                    For the graphs and charts, I used a library called <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/" target="blank_"><b>Chart.js</b></a>.

                    What-if Hypothetical Implementations in Minecraft (WHIMC) leverages Minecraft as a learning environment for learners to interactively explore the scientific

                    My role in this research group was creating plugins to aid in the collection of data.
                    On top of this, I also managed the server files and the database that stored player data.

                    The game is a modified version of Pacman that gets crazier as you play. I created the
                    framework of the game as well as modified sound files to fit what's happening.
